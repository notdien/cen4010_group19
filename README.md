IOS app TO-do list that will allow users to create an account and create their own personal to-do lists!

## Stack

We plan to create the IOS app using React-Native, ExpressJS - Typescript and MongoDB

## How to use

### 'npm install -g typescript' to install ts

### Please remember to NPM install for node_modules - afterwards CD into backend folder and type in "npm run dev".

### Create a new keys.ts in your backend to ensure that you have connection to the DB/ I can provide the file.

### Make sure all your created JS files from your TS files are in the dist file or you will run into errors.

### Run 'npx tsc' if you need to update your JS file from your TS file.
